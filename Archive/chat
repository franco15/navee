I’m here to help you pick the best manga for you.

-Game of thrones

Oh yes, winter is coming! :)

I have some great ideas for you.

Berserk from Kentarō Miura

Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world,
the story centers on isolation, camaraderie, and the
question of whether humanity is fundamentally good or
evil. Graphic violence and sexual content pervade the story.
